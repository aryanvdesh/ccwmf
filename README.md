## Correlating Concepts with Math Formulas

- The idea of the project was to find concepts that have the highest co-occurrence with specified Mathematical keywords. The data was scraped from the arXiv API, and the highest occurring words were found using regular expressions and processed using basic natural language processing.

### How to Run

- The code has been broken down into two parts:
	1. Function notation
	2. Expanded code

- How to run the Function notation code:
	- The function has to be defined for it to take arguments. Press [Shift + Enter] after the last square bracket, if the function name color turns grey the function has been defined and you can now run the function by giving it two arguments, a URL and a search word (example notation can be seen on the line following the function declaration)

- How to run using the Expanded code:
	- The code has been broken down in two parts: 
		- Importing Data
		- Processing Text
	- Both of them have to be compiled according to their order, in which you can change the search word in the variable 'regx' and the URL in the 'url' variable. If you have changed the 'regx' variable the 'regxd' variable also needs to be updated.

*To compile a line press [Shift + Enter]
