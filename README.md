## Correlating Concepts with Math Formulas

- The idea of the project was to find concepts that have the highest co-occurrence with specified Mathematical keywords. The data was scraped from the arXiv API, and the highest occurring words were found using regular expressions and processed using basic natural language processing.

### How to Run

- The code has been broken down into two parts:
	- Function notation
		- Function with user-defined steps
		- Function without user-defined steps
	- Expanded code

- How to run using the code:
	- The code has been broken down in two parts: 
		- Importing Data
		- Processing Data
			- Finding the word
			- Processing the text (Removing stopwords, whitespaces)
	- Both of them have to be compiled according to their order, in which you can change the search word in the variable 'regx' and the URL in the 'url' variable. If you have changed the 'regx' variable the 'regxd' variable also needs to be updated.
